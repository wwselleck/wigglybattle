# Wigglybattle

This project is a mostly-educational venture into creating an engine and clients for Pokemon battling.

The first goal of the project is to create a Node-based engine for handling the actual battling. Then I'll work on integrating the engine into a API, and clients (web, Discord bot, terminal).
